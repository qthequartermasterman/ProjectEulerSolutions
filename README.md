# ProjectEulerSolutions
C++ solutions for Project Euler. Intended for a refresh in C++.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a fun set of problems at the intersection of math (particularly number and graph theory) and computer science.
The problems start relatively simple, but quickly grow in difficulty--requiring comfort both in the requisite branches of math and in algorithm design, so to quickly quickly compute answers.

This repository neither tries to present the most elegant nor the fastest solutions to any particular problem, but instead be a practice in C++ and algorithm analysis.
